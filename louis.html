			<h3>
				When he was only sixteen years old, Louis Vuitton made a decision that
				would not only change his own life but the lives of his sons and future
				generations: he would become a trunk-master.
			</h3>
			<p>
				It was in 1837 that a 16-year-old Louis Vuitton arrived in Paris by foot
				and started apprenticing for Monsieur Maréchal. At the time, horse-drawn
				carriages, boats and trains were the main modes of transportation, and
				baggage was handled roughly. Travelers called upon craftsmen to pack and
				protect their individual objects. Louis Vuitton quickly became a valued
				craftsman at the Parisian atelier of Monsieur Maréchal. These were the
				roots of his highly specialized trade; the beginnings of his career in
				an artisanal industry that called upon skills to custom design boxes
				and, later, trunks according to clients’ wishes. Louis Vuitton stayed
				for 17 years before opening his own workshop at 4 Rue
				Neuve-des-Capucines near the Place Vendome.

				was a French fashion designer and businessman. He was the founder of the
				Louis Vuitton brand of leather goods now owned by LVMH. Prior to this,
				he had been appointed as trunk-maker to Empress Eugénie de Montijo, wife
				of Napoleon III.
